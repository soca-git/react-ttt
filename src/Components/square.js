// In React, function components are a simpler way to write components that only contain a render method and donâ€™t have their own state.
// Instead of defining a class which extends React.Component, we can write a function that takes props as input and returns what should be rendered.
// Function components are less tedious to write than classes, and many components can be expressed this way.
// Functions components generally receive props and return JSX; i.e. they are pure functions with no side-effects.

export default Square;
